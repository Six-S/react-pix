## React Pics

This is a course project for [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

This is a small, one page site that will load up a few high quality images based on user specified search terms.
The images are rendered out in a nice looking, user friendly way.

To run this project, simply:

```sh
npm install && npm start
```

The project is intended to further implement general good practice when writing React, as well as introduce newer students to a few new React concepts.
There is nothing particularly crazy in this project, but it does showcase proper project structure, as well as good syntactical practice,
and compartmentalized components that are effective and easily reusable in new locations.
